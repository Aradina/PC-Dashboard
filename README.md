# PC-Dashboard

This is an exceptionally work in progress program to allow for easy management of installed PC games with a controller friendly interface. It isn't currently in a complete state and I don't recommend trying to use it.

## Current Features

Imports installed games from Steam and Xbox, presents them in a grid. Click to launch. 

Controller support largely functions for UI navigation.

## Planned Features

Importing of any installed game, ideally automatically.
